# LeddarSDK

LeddarSDK is c++ cross-platform SDK that allows you to connect to LeddarTech sensors.  
Online documentation can be found [here](http://sdk.leddartech.com)

## 2 - Compiling LeddarSDK

=======================

Build process uses cmake (<https://cmake.org>). The CMakeLists.txt file is in src folder. It is recommended to do an out of source build in the folder `src/release`

You can choose for what sensor to build the sdk using cmake project configuration. All sensors are enabled by default.

### Linux build

To build the LeddarSDK using CMakeList.txt, as mentionned above we recommand an out of source build, in the folder `src/release`

```bash
cd "LEDDARSDK_INSTALLATION_PATH"/src
mkdir release
cmake ..
make
```

The LeddarExample will be the available in the release folder. See below to run the example.

Note : you might need to install additional library. For example
    libusbx-devel on fedora or libusb-1.0-0-dev on debian

### Window build

CMake is directly integrated in visual studio, you can check the documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/cmake-projects-in-visual-studio?view=msvc-160)

## 3 - Running LeddarExample

=========================

### Linux example

USB and Serial:

You need to give user rights to the USB port or run the example using the "sudo" command.

To change USB access, create a file in /etc/udev/rules.d, for example `90-LeddarTech.rules` and add this line: `ATTRS{idVendor}=="28f1",MODE="0666"`

SPI using FTDI cable:

To access the device, you need to run first this command provided by the FTDI documentation:
    `sudo rmmod ftdi_sio`
    `sudo rmmod usbserial`

In order to run the example for the Vu8 sensor, you need to run it with the following command (with the correct PATHTO and architecture (x64, x86 or ARM):  
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/PATHTO/LeddarSDK/libs/FTDI/linux/x64:/PATHTO/LeddarSDK/libs/MPSSE/linux/x64 ./LeddarExample

You need to give user rights to the USB port or run the example using the "sudo" command.

To change USB access, create a file in `/etc/udev/rules.d`, for example `91-FTDI-SPI.rules` and add this line: `ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403",MODE="0666"`

## 4 - Python Package

==================  
First you need to build the SDK using instructions found at step 2 - [Compiling LeddarSDK](#2---compiling-leddarsdk)

This step suppose you have built the sdk in the "release" folder. If your build folder is different, you need to update the path in the setup.py script

### Linux python

In folder LeddarPy run `python setup.py install --user`

### Windows python

Depending on your python version and visual studio version, `python setup.py install` can work (see <https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers/>)  
Else you can open the .sln in LeddarPy folder and build the solution (Visual studio 2017)

## 5 - ROS package

==================  
We provide a ROS (<https://www.ros.org/>) package that uses our python package. Instructions can be found in the Leddar_ROS folder.
